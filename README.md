#### Description:
HTML Code:
The index.html file contains a webpage that displays an Easybank landing page. The page includes four main sections: the header, hero section, feature section, and articles section.

Header Section:
The header section includes a logo of the Easybank website and a navigation menu that includes links to different pages such as Home, About, Contact, Blog, and Careers. The navigation menu is hidden for mobile devices and can be toggled by clicking the hamburger button. To add the hamburger menu button to your webpage, you need to include HTML code for the button with an ID of "btnHamburger". To create the menu overlay, add the HTML code with a class of "overlay". Finally, to add any other content you want to animate, include the HTML code for the header with a class of "header".

Hero Section:
The hero section includes a large image and a text that promotes the services of Easybank. The text also includes a call-to-action button for requesting an invite.

Feature Section:
The feature section highlights the benefits of using Easybank, such as online banking, simple budgeting, fast onboarding, and open API. Each benefit is presented in a separate box with an icon and a description.

Articles Section:
The articles section displays the latest articles published on the website. Each article is presented as a box with an image, author, title, and description. Clicking on the box takes the user to the full article.

CSS Code:
The CSS code provides the animation effects for the webpage. The CSS includes the fade-in and fade-out classes for animating elements with the class "has-fade", as well as any other styles you want to apply.

JavaScript Code:
The script.js file provides an interactive hamburger menu animation that opens and closes a menu when a button is clicked. It adds or removes CSS classes to various elements to achieve the desired animation effects. To use this code, you need to add the JavaScript code to your webpage. The code should be placed in a script tag after the HTML elements it interacts with. The code selects various elements using document.querySelector() and document.querySelectorAll(), adds an event listener to the hamburger menu button, and toggles CSS classes to animate the menu.

LICENSE:
The code is licensed under the MIT license, which allows you to use the code however you like.
